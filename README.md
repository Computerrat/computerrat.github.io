Go to Github.com and create an account using an email address. Students should not use their PHSC email since after graduation they will lose access to that account. (My account was created using my personal gmail account. Consideration should also be given to choosing a username since that will be how you will become known in the cyber world. My username is computerrat because that has been my online identity since the first time I used a computer with a modem.)

Go to https://pages.github.com/ and then create a repository using the username that was created in the first step, followed by.github.io. (Check out my repository at https://computerrat.github.io)

This step is optional: Users can download Github Desktop and clone their repository onto their local system.

In order to add files to your repository, all you have to do is click on the Upload files button, and then drag and drop your files or folder. Once the files have uploaded, you have to click on the green Commit button at the bottom of the page. I found it easier to use a folder containing all of my files, because any changes that are made will be automatically made since the files will be overwritten. This makes it easier to test code changes such as CSS style modifications or other script changes.

Once your repository is created, it is very simple to create projects. The important part is that there must be an index.html file included in each project. I created a very basic project, which I called GithubTest. I used html, css, and a small piece of javascript. You can go to https://computerrat.github.io/GithubTest/index.html to check out my sample, or you could visit https://computerrat.github.io/Voyage/index.html to check out my adventure story created for my advanced web design class.
